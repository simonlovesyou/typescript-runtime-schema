# @typescript-runtime-schema/transform ![version](https://badgen.net/badge/version/0.1.1/blue)
Typescript transform which enriches source code with runtime schema validation

## Comparison
There are other packages similar to this one, like [`typescript-is`](https://github.com/woutervh-/typescript-is). The intention of this package is to, in future version, support "schema like" identifiers that will tell the compiler that the runtime value should conform to some constraint so that you can provide contentful validation with your types. Example:
```ts
import { is } from '@typescript-runtime-schema/lib'
import { UUID, Maximum, Minimum, Email } from '@typescript-runtime-schema/lib/contentful'

type User = {
  id: string & UUID<'v4'>,
  name: string & Minimum<10> & Maximum<50>,
  email: string & Email
}

const validatePayloadAsUser = (something: any) => {
  return is<User>(something)
}
```

### Disclaimer
Please note that the above example is a draft of what the future API _may_ look like and is subject to change. The "contentful" utility types are not yet implemented as of this version of the package.
## Installation
Using npm:
```
npm install @typescript-runtime-schema/transform
```
Using yarn:
```
yarn add @typescript-runtime-schema/transform
```
# Usage

This package exposes a TypeScript transformer factory at `@typescript-runtime-schema/factory`

Custom typescript transformers is natively supported _internally_ in TypeScript, but is not publically exposed. The current recommended workaround is to replace your `typescript` compiler with [ttypescript](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript) which is a TypeScript compiler wrapper that exposes the internal transformers API.

(Please [vote here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14419) to support transformers out-of-the-box)

## `ttypescript`
_For `ttypescript` installation instructions, please see the [ttypescript repo](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript)_

Add a `plugins` property to `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` and specify `@typescript-runtime-schema/transformer` as your transformer:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "plugins": [
            { "transform": "@typescript-runtime-schema/transformer" }
        ]
    }
}
```

Build your typescript project like you previously would, but replace your usage of `tsc` with `ttsc`

```bash
## Examples:
npx ttsc
# or
./node_modules/.bin/ttsc --project .
```

### `ts-node`, `webpack`, `Rollup`
Please read the instructions of [ttypescript](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript/blob/master/README.md) for information on how to use it in combination with `ts-node`, `webpack`, and `Rollup`.

Note: This will not work if `ts-loader` is configured with `transpileOnly: true`.

## Options

There are currently no options supported for this package. Options will be available and exposed in future version of the package.
